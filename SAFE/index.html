                <p class="intro-text">Modern, commercial digital locks have several glaring flaws that make cracking them easy for even the most novice criminals.
                     Among these flaws is the ability to unlock a digital lock by simply bringing a strong magnet close enough. 
                     This type of attack is known as magnetic tampering, and it was the inspiration for this project. 
                     The questions I sought to answer were (1), “How could I design a digital locking system that was impervious to magnetic tampering?” and (2), 
                     “What unique unlocking mechanisms are accessible to such a system?”. 
                    <br><br>
                    To answer these questions, I designed the Sensor-Assisted Fluxgate Enclosure (S.A.F.E.). By measuring a magnetic field as part of the unlocking mechanism,
                     this system is impervious to magnetic tampering. Furthermore, by using a 2-axis fluxgate sensor, S.A.F.E. recognizes different positions and orientations 
                     of a magnetic key to record a combination that unlocks the safe or triggers its alarm.

                    The magnetic sensor I used for this project was a 2D, ring-core fluxgate magnetic field sensor. 
                    Ring-core fluxgate sensors are multiaxial and capable of detecting very small magnetic fields. They consist of a soft-magnetic toroidal core. 
                    Wire is wrapped circularly along the thickness of the toroid to create a drive coil. Along orthogonal diameters of the toroid, 
                    two more coils are wrapped to sense the X and Y dimensions. 
                    <br><br>
                    ε=(-ⅆϕ)/ⅆt
                    <br>
                    Eqn. 1: Faraday’s Law
                    <br><br>
                    When a sufficiently large AC signal passes through the drive coil, the soft-magnetic core is periodically driven into and out of positive saturation 
                    and into and out of negative saturation. When the core is saturated, its permeability is low, and magnetic flux lines are pushed away. When the core 
                    is unsaturated, its permeability is suddenly extremely high, pulling flux lines in. This sudden change in flux is registered as a voltage spike in the 
                    sense coils as according to Faraday’s law. Under an external magnetic field, the flux through the sensor is changed, causing the amplitude of the voltage 
                    spikes to increase or decrease. By detecting these voltage changes, one can reason about the magnetic field near the sensor.

                            ferrite core for 94 turns. Wire guides were laser-cut and attached to the ferrite core with double-
                            sided scotch tape to correctly align the sense coils. 30 AWG wire was again wrapped along
                            orthogonal diameters of the toroid for as many turns as would fit between the wire guides. Because
                            this process had to be repeated several times due to the 30 AWG wire breaking, the number of
                            sense-axis turns was not counted. A small flame was used to remove the enamel coating from the
                            leads. 22 AWG wire was soldered to the leads to provide better connection and interfacing.

                        <p class="port-title-description">Saturation current was experimentally measured. Circuit topology was designed as according to
                            Fig. 1. Circuit was simulated using LTSpice. Based on simulation results, R6 was chosen such that
                            the necessary saturation current flowed through the sensor. Following simulation, circuitry was
                            assembled on a single breadboard. Optimal capacitor values were determined experimentally by trial
                            and error. Sense coil outputs were wired to analog input ports on the Arduino. Protection diodes
                            were connected from the sense coil outputs to ground. The Sparkfun TB6612FNG motor controller
                            was used in combination with the Arduino to drive the 2nd door motor. The speaker was wired in
                            parallel with a 1000 Ohm resistor and driven by a 500 Hz, 0-5V, 50% duty-cycle PWM signal from
                            the Arduino. 4 AA batteries were used to provide 6V Vdd. Laptop and USB cable were used to
                            power the Arduino and provide 5V Vcc. Wires were soldered to leads of the push button and dc
                            motor to allow for a longer connection. The push button was wired to ground and a digital input of
                            the Arduino.

                            The Arduino IDE was used to develop the necessary code. Sparkfun TB6612FNG library was
                            installed to help interface with the motor controller. An interrupt was attached to the falling edge of
                            the push button (active LOW) to trigger the code to begin recording sensor data. Five averages were
                            taken each trigger. X and Y sensor values were experimentally determined for each combo location
                            and hardcoded thereafter. During operation, the sensor values are compared to the hardcoded
                            values. The combo location corresponding to the smallest Euclidean distance to the measured value
                            is recorded.
